== About ==

Library containing a PHP implementation of the Contributors extension

This extension analyzes the individual contributions according to a few factors.
* Number of added, removed and changed characters
* Number of added, removed and changed triplets
* Number of added, removed and changed entrophy

Individual entries are spread over a vector before before being accumulated in bins. The values in those bins
are then used for calculating total additions, removals and changes.
